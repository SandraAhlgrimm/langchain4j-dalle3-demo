2. Please, change the prompt or rerun the same prompt multiple times to see the differences.

```json
Prompt: "Create an image of a horse race with three horses."

revisedPrompt = "Imagine a dynamic scene of a horse race.
There are three horses vigorously running on a turf track with determination in their eyes.
One horse is white with a streamlined build, the other is a majestic black stallion with a glossy coat, and the third is a vibrant chestnut horse with strong muscular legs.
Their jockeys are skillfully riding them; a Middle-Eastern woman in blue silks on the white horse, a Hispanic man in red silks on the black stallion, and a Caucasian woman in green silks riding the chestnut horse.
It's a bright sunny day, and the crowd in the stands is a blur of excited faces and colorful attire."
```
